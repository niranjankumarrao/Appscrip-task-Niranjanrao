# Appscrip-task-Niranjan

A simple Product Listing Page (PLP) built with Next.js.  
This is a fresher-style implementation — kept intentionally simple and easy to read.

## What I did
- Used FakeStore API for product data.
- Static categories (Men, Women, Electronics, Jewellery).
- Functional Show/Hide filter (works on all screen sizes).
- Sorting dropdown (Recommended, Newest, Price low-high, Price high-low).
- Mobile layout matches the provided screenshots: filter and sort controls on top, products below.
- Small, readable code with a few comments and TODOs.

## How to run
1. Install:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Run locally:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   open http://localhost:3000

3. Build & export for Netlify:
   ```
   npm run build
   npm run export
   ```
   The `out` folder can be deployed to Netlify.
